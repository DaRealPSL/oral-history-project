        What Have I Learned?
      </h2>

      <p>
        For this oral history project, I interviewed my grandmother, Anneke Bos
        van der Vis. She was born in 1947, just after the Second World War, and
        grew up during the Cold War. The goal of the project was to understand
        how historical events during that time influenced her youth. I followed
        the steps of preparing, planning, and conducting an interview to learn
        more about her personal experiences and how they connect to this
        important time in history.

        Early Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        Anneke was born in a small town called Koudekerk aan den Rijn. After the
        war, life was hard. There was not much food or money, and people were
        trying to rebuild their homes and daily lives. Her parents worked hard
        to support the family. At that time, the Cold War had not fully started,
        but the world was already changing.

        Living Through the Cold War
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the 1960s, when Anneke was a teenager, she started to see the effects
        of the Cold War. She remembers the <strong>Berlin Wall</strong> being
        built in 1961 and feeling sad that people could not travel freely.
        During the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong> in 1962, her family was
        worried about war. Even though the Netherlands was not in danger, people
        were afraid of nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also followed the news about events in Eastern Europe, like the{" "}
        <strong>Hungarian Uprising</strong> in 1956. These stories made her feel
        lucky to live in a free country, but also afraid of what might happen.
        Even if the Cold War did not reach her directly, it was always in the
        background.

        Different Perspectives
      </h3>
      <p>
        For Anneke, the Cold War was not about politics or leaders. It was about
        the feeling of fear, the news on the radio, and the things her family
        talked about at home. She did not think she was part of history, but her
        life was still shaped by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, learning about the Cold War was different. In school, I learn
        about years and facts. But talking to my grandmother helped me see the
        Cold War as a time when people were really worried, even if they lived
        far away from the main events. Her story made history feel more real.

        What I Have Learned
      </h3>
      <p>
        This interview taught me that history is not only in books. It is also
        in people's memories. I learned how big events can affect normal lives,
        even if someone is not directly involved. I also saw how important it is
        to listen to stories from people who lived through important times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this project, I understand the Cold War in a new way. I feel
        closer to history and to my grandmother.
