        What Have I Learned?
      </h2>

      <p>
        For this oral history project, I wanted to answer the question:{" "}
        <strong>
          "What was it like to grow up during the Cold War as a regular person
          in the Netherlands?"
        </strong>
        To find out, I interviewed my grandmother, Anneke Bos van der Vis. She
        was born in 1947, just after World War II. I wanted to understand how
        her life was affected by the Cold War and how she remembers that time.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Anneke was born in a small town called Koudekerk aan den Rijn. After the
        war, life was difficult. There was not much food or money, and people
        were trying to rebuild their homes and lives. Her parents worked hard to
        take care of the family. At that time, the Cold War had not yet fully
        started, but things were already changing.
      </p>

      <h3>Living Through the Cold War</h3>
      <p>
        In the 1960s, when Anneke was a teenager, she started to see the effects
        of the Cold War. She remembers the <strong>Berlin Wall</strong> being
        built in 1961 and feeling sad that people were not allowed to travel
        freely. During the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong> in 1962, her
        family was worried about war. Even though the Netherlands was not in
        danger, people were afraid of nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also follwed the news about events in Eastern Europe, like the
        <strong>Hungarian Uprising</strong> in 1956. These stories made her feel
        lucky to live in a free country, but also scared about what could
        happen. Even if the Cold War did not touch her directly, it was always
        there in the background.
      </p>

      <h3>Different Perspectives</h3>
      <p>
        For Anneke, the Cold War was not about politics or leaders. It was about
        the feeling of fear, the news on the radio, and the things her family
        talked about at home. She didn't think she was part of history, but her
        life was still shaped by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, learning about the Cold War was different. In school, I learn
        about years and facts. But talking to my grandmother helped me see the
        Cold War as a time when people were really worried, even if they lived
        far from the fighting. Her story made history feel more real.
      </p>

      <h3>What Have I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This interview taught me that history is not only in books. It is also
        in people's memories. I learned how big events can affect normal lives,
        even if someone is not in the middle of them. I also saw how importtant
        it is to listen to stories from people who lived through important
        times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this project, I understand the Cold War in a new way. I feel
        closer to history and to my grandmother.
